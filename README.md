***

~~The Hot Spring Water textures are ripped straight from [Glitchfiend/Biomes O' Plenty](https://github.com/Glitchfiend/BiomesOPlenty/tree/BOP-1.12.x-7.0.x/src/main/resources/assets/biomesoplenty/textures/blocks).~~ Textures are no longer stolen from Biomes O' Plenty! Wow! Don't worry though, they still look quite similar.
